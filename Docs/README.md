# Isolated

Genre: Runner / Survival

Government told everybody to self-isolate. Your goal is to manage and get resources and keep yourself calm. 
You start with some food, money, toilet paper and meds.
You also have a panic meter, that is growing while you are stuck indoors, or when you are being coughed at during the food run. 
Once you run out of food, or meds you start panicking really fast, so keep shelves stuffed.
You have to survive one week.
